## 📖 The Story Behind This Project

### The Beginning
This isn't just another Rock Paper Scissors game - it's the milestone that marked my first real dive into JavaScript programming. What started as a simple console-based game has evolved into a fully interactive web application, representing months of learning, debugging, and growth.

### The Challenge
When I first approached this project, I was faced with fundamental programming concepts that seemed daunting:
- How do you make a computer make random choices?
- How do you implement game logic that determines winners?
- How do you transform user interactions into meaningful gameplay?

### The Journey
The breakthrough came when I discovered how `Math.random()` could be combined with a `switch` statement to translate randomness into decisions. Suddenly, the computer had a "mind" of its own! The second major hurdle was implementing the game logic - understanding how rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. It was fascinating to see how different JavaScript concepts intertwined to create something interactive and fun.

### The Evolution
What began as a console-only experience has transformed into a beautiful, responsive web application. The journey from `prompt()` dialogs to interactive buttons, from console logs to dynamic score displays, represents not just technical growth but a fundamental shift in how I think about user experience.

- **Bootstrap 5.3.3** - UI components and responsive grid
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control and collaboration

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Interactive Gameplay** - Click buttons instead of typing commands
- 📊 **Real-time Scoring** - Dynamic score tracking for both player and computer
- 🔄 **Round Counter** - Visual feedback on game progress
- ⏱️ **Animated Reveals** - Suspenseful 1-second delay before showing computer's choice
- 🎨 **Bootstrap UI** - Clean, modern interface with colorful buttons

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkimZmerli/rockPaperScissors.git
   cd rockPaperScissors
   ```

2. **Open the game**
   ```bash

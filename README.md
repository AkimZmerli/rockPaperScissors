# Classical Game "Rock, Paper & Scissors"

This game will be played inside the console only. You will receive a promt to play the game.

Good luck beating the mashines. 




## About this project

As you can tell by my history, this has been my very first JavaScript project. Without a doubt it has been more challenging than my previous projects. 
At first I didn't know where to start or how to initiate the random choices by the computer. A hint paved the way to connect the method .Math.random with a switch statement, 
so the random factor becomes translated into a decision. 

The second challenge posed the logic during a round as in how would the script know, which elements beat other elements. Again I was lucky to receive a hint pointing in the right connection. It was interesting how several previously learned concepts of JavaScript became intertwined with each other. 

Although I couldn't do this project without asking for help, the learning curve was tremendous and I feel relieved and proud getting to this point. 


## Future steps 

Once the logic is in place I will start implementing front-end elements so the game will be played outside the console. 
More little games will follow such as Knight Travails, Battleship and TicTacToe. 

So stay tuned.
